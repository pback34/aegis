# Q-9: Security & Authentication Implementation

## Question

What detailed security implementation approach should we use for authentication, authorization, encryption, and audit logging?

## Context

*This is a placeholder Question for future research. To be addressed after Q-6 and Q-7 are complete and we understand the core API and data requirements.*

## Research Objectives

- Authentication flows (OAuth, JWT, refresh tokens, MFA)
- Authorization model (RBAC, permissions, resource-based access)
- Encryption implementation (data at rest, in transit, field-level)
- Audit logging strategy and compliance requirements
- Incident response procedures

## Priority & Timeline

- **Priority:** Medium (critical for production, less critical for demo)
- **Timeline:** To be determined
- **Status:** Pending - will be activated after Q-6/Q-7 decisions

## Notes

For MVP/demo, basic JWT authentication with role-based access may be sufficient. This Question explores production-grade security requirements including CCPA compliance, SOC 2, penetration testing, etc.
