# R-4: Operations & Quality Control Research Report

**Research Question:** What operational procedures, vetting processes, and quality control measures should Aegis implement to ensure consistent service quality and safety?

**Research Date:** November 9, 2025
**Research Method:** Operations research, vendor analysis, industry best practices
**Confidence Level:** High (90%) - Based on comprehensive vendor comparisons, industry standards, and operational research

---

## Executive Summary

This research provides comprehensive operational frameworks for Aegis across vetting, training, quality control, and 24/7 operations. Key findings include:

**Background Checks:** Checkr offers the fastest turnaround (98% in <1 hour) at competitive pricing, ideal for on-demand platforms. GoodHire provides expert-reviewed accuracy with <0.1% error rate but slightly longer processing. Costs range from $40-180 per check depending on comprehensiveness.

**Vetting Standards:** Beyond legal minimums, industry best practices require fingerprint-based FBI checks (3-10 days for unarmed, 20-35 days for armed), continuous monitoring services, and comprehensive disqualification criteria for violent crimes, theft, and dishonesty offenses.

**Training Infrastructure:** Platforms like Defencify (92% completion rate) enable scalable online training for platform orientation and procedures. In-person training remains essential for use-of-force, de-escalation, and equipment handling. California requires 8 hours annual continuing education.

**Supply-Demand Optimization:** Research shows dynamic pricing can increase platform profit 1.25-1.85x while reducing idle capacity. Surge multipliers typically stay below 1.5x. Optimal strategies combine time-varying pricing, commission adjustments, and incentive bonuses for high-availability guards.

**Quality Control:** Industry KPIs include on-time arrival rate, customer ratings (with <60% alert threshold for quality issues), Mean Time to Detect/Remediate incidents, and 98%+ attendance rates. Real-time monitoring and mystery shopping programs ensure consistent service quality.

**24/7 Operations:** Building in-house 24/7 operations costs 8.8x more than SOC-as-a-Service models over three years. Minimum staffing requires 10-30 personnel for extended operations. AI-driven automation reduces workload for log analysis, incident triage, and threat detection.
