# Q-8: Matching Algorithm Design

## Question

How should the guard-to-job matching algorithm work to efficiently and fairly match available guards with customer job requests?

## Context

*This is a placeholder Question for future research. To be addressed after Q-6 and Q-7 are complete and we have clear API and data model foundations.*

## Research Objectives

- Scoring criteria (location proximity, skills, ratings, availability)
- Real-time vs batch matching approaches
- Fairness and distribution algorithms
- Edge cases (no available guards, multiple simultaneous requests)
- Performance and scalability considerations

## Priority & Timeline

- **Priority:** Medium (important but not blocking MVP demo)
- **Timeline:** To be determined
- **Status:** Pending - will be activated after Q-6/Q-7 decisions

## Notes

For MVP/demo, a simple matching algorithm (nearest available guard with required skills) may be sufficient. This Question explores more sophisticated approaches for production.
