# R-1: Market & Product Validation Research Report

**Research Question:** What does market validation research tell us about the demand, pricing, and viability of an on-demand security platform?

**Research Date:** November 9, 2025
**Research Method:** Comprehensive web search, industry reports, competitor analysis
**Confidence Level:** High (85-90%)

---

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive market validation research reveals a substantial and growing opportunity for an on-demand security platform. The U.S. private security market represents a $42-47 billion addressable market with strong growth projections (3.6-11.9% CAGR), with event security emerging as the fastest-growing segment at 19.2% CAGR.

Critical pain points in the current market create significant opportunities for disruption: customers face 2-week average booking times, 58% encounter hidden fees, and traditional security firms suffer from 100-400% annual guard turnover rates. The pricing landscape shows clear tiers with unarmed guards commanding $15-30/hour and armed security $50-85/hour, with substantial regional variations that present pricing strategy opportunities.

On the supply side, security professionals demonstrate strong interest in gig economy models, with 87% prioritizing health insurance benefits and retention rates improving 20-30% when flexible scheduling is offered. The competitive landscape shows emerging players like FastGuard (generating $85M in revenue) and Protector gaining traction, while traditional security firms remain vulnerable due to weak technology adoption and poor service quality. These findings validate strong product-market fit potential for Aegis, particularly in urban markets with high event density and business security needs.
