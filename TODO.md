## 🔧 Backend Setup Complete - Local Development Environment Ready!

**What Was Completed This Session:**
1. ✅ **PostgreSQL Database** - Created `aegis_mvp` database successfully
2. ✅ **Database Migrations** - Ran TypeORM migrations, created all tables (users, guard_profiles, bookings, location_updates, payments)
3. ✅ **Dependency Injection Fixes** - Fixed all NestJS DI issues across 13 use case files
4. ✅ **Service Configuration** - Configured factory providers for Ably and Stripe adapters
5. ✅ **Backend Server** - Successfully started on http://localhost:3000
6. ✅ **All 15 API Endpoints** - Verified active and ready for frontend integration
7. ✅ **Git Commit** - Committed and pushed all fixes to remote repository

**Technical Fixes Made:**
- Added `@Inject()` decorators to all use case constructors for repository interfaces:
  - `@Inject('IUserRepository')` in auth and user use cases
  - `@Inject('IBookingRepository')` in booking use cases
  - `@Inject('ILocationRepository')` in location use cases
  - `@Inject('IPaymentRepository')` in payment use cases
  - `@Inject('IPaymentGateway')` in payment use cases
  - `@Inject('ILocationService')` in location use cases
- Added `@Injectable()` decorator to `SimpleMatchingService`
- Configured factory providers in [app.module.ts](mvp/packages/backend/src/app.module.ts):
  - `ILocationService` with ConfigService injection (Ably adapter)
  - `IPaymentGateway` with ConfigService injection (Stripe adapter)
- Implemented graceful degradation for missing Ably API key (logs warning, doesn't crash)

## 🎯 Next Steps - Phase 5 Task 5: Payment Integration with Stripe

**Goal**: Integrate Stripe payment processing for booking payments with authorization and capture flow

**What to Build:**
1. Stripe Elements integration:
   - Install @stripe/stripe-js and @stripe/react-stripe-js
   - Create payment form component with card input
   - Handle payment intent creation
   - Implement payment authorization flow
2. Payment authorization (on booking creation):
   - Authorize payment when customer creates booking
   - Store payment intent ID in booking
   - Show payment status in UI
3. Payment capture (on job completion):
   - Automatically capture payment when guard completes job
   - Update payment status display
   - Show final payment breakdown
4. Payment status tracking:
   - Display payment status throughout booking lifecycle
   - Show authorization pending, authorized, captured, failed states
   - Handle payment errors gracefully

**Dependencies to Install:**
```bash
cd mvp/packages/frontend
npm install @stripe/stripe-js @stripe/react-stripe-js
```

**Files to Create:**
```
components/payment/payment-form.tsx       # Stripe Elements payment form
components/payment/payment-status.tsx     # Payment status display
lib/stripe-client.ts                      # Stripe client wrapper
```

**Files to Update:**
```
components/customer/create-booking-form.tsx  # Add payment form
components/customer/booking-detail.tsx       # Enhanced payment status
components/guard/active-job-view.tsx         # Payment capture on completion
```

**Payment Flow:**
1. Customer creates booking → payment form appears
2. Customer enters card details → payment authorized
3. Guard accepts and completes job → payment captured automatically
4. Customer and guard see payment status updates in real-time

**API Endpoints Already Available:**
- `POST /payments/authorize` - Authorize payment (Customer)
- `POST /payments/capture` - Capture payment (Guard, on job completion)

## ⚠️ Important Implementation Notes

### Auth Pattern
```typescript
// lib/api-client.ts
const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3000',
});

apiClient.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('accessToken');
  if (token) {
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  }
  return config;
});
```

### Protected Routes
```typescript
// app/(authenticated)/layout.tsx
export default function AuthenticatedLayout({ children }) {
  const { user, loading } = useAuth();

  if (loading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
  if (!user) redirect('/login');

  return <>{children}</>;
}
```

### Real-Time Location with Ably
```typescript
// components/map/mapbox-map.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const ably = new Ably.Realtime({
    key: ablyKey, // from /map/config
  });

  const channel = ably.channels.get(`jobs:${jobId}:location`);

  channel.subscribe('location-update', (message) => {
    const { latitude, longitude, timestamp } = message.data;
    setGuardLocation({ lat: latitude, lng: longitude });
  });

  return () => {
    channel.unsubscribe();
    ably.close();
  };
}, [jobId]);
```

### Guard Location Tracking
```typescript
// components/guard/location-tracker.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const sendLocation = async () => {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(async (position) => {
      await apiClient.post(`/jobs/${jobId}/location`, {
        latitude: position.coords.latitude,
        longitude: position.coords.longitude,
        accuracyMeters: position.coords.accuracy,
      });
    });
  };

  // Send location every 10 seconds
  const interval = setInterval(sendLocation, 10000);
  sendLocation(); // Send immediately

  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [jobId]);
```

---

## 💡 Key Gotchas

1. **Ably Channel Names**: Must match backend format `jobs:{jobId}:location`
2. **Mapbox Token**: Fetch from `/map/config`, don't hardcode
3. **Location Permissions**: Handle browser geolocation permission denial gracefully
4. **Token Refresh**: Implement auto-refresh interceptor for 401 errors
5. **Role-Based UI**: Show different dashboard based on `user.role`
6. **Real-Time Latency**: Target <2 seconds for location updates
